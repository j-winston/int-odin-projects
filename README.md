### Try It Out
---
[A kinder, more loving form](https://j-winston.github.io/odin-signup-form/)

### Introduction 
---
Enter your information....now email....now password...now shoot me. And if you're like
most people, you are completely sick of being prompted to type your information
into little rectangles on a lit up screen. 

And after using my form, I can say with certainty you won't feel any different. 

However, I did my best to mitigate some of the suicidal impact of your average 
form. Namely--

* Stop flashing red while I am still typing. It's like you're yelling at me.  
* Give me immediate feedback when I'm doing it right. Because instant gratification feels good. 
* Don't give me your feedback until I leave the field. I feel rushed. 
* And please, please don't tell me my passwords don't match until AFTER I am done. 
Because, you guessed it..I am still typing. 
* Last, do test your form on small phones. Not all of us want to lug around
a monster geekbox in our pockets. 

But seriously, forms are both vital and annoying as hell. As developers, we  
can help ease the pain with a little thoughtfullness and common sense. 

### Technologies

I stumbled across this [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/vponamariov/status/1400388896136040454).
The author points out examples of forms with poor UX and I've seen it everywhere. Also, I needed to complete
this for The Odin Project. Shout out to Odin.
