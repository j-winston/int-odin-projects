### Introduction

Enter your information....now email....now password. Now shoot me. And if you're like
most people, you are completely sick of being prompted to type your information
into rectangles in front of a screen. 

And after using my form, you won't feel very different. 

However, I did my best to mitigate some of the suicidal impact of your average 
form. Namely--

* Don't flash red everywhere while I am still typing. It's like you're yelling at me. No.  
* Don't give me your feedback until I leave the field. I feel like I am being rushed. 
* And please, please don't tell me my passwords don't match until AFTER I am done. 
Because, you guessed it..I am still typing. 
* Last, please test your form on small phones. Not all of us want to lug around
a monster geekbox in our pockets. 

But seriously, forms are both vital and annoying as hell. As developers, we  
can help ease the pain with a little thoughtfullness and common sense.

I stumbled across this [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/vponamariov/status/1400388896136040454).
The author points out poor UX and I swear i've seen it anywhere. Also, I needed to complete
this for The Odin Project. Shout out to Odin.
